# Advent of Code solutions
Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in Rust.

## Running locally
The command line tool takes `<year> <day> <part>` as arguments and reads the problem input from stdin:

```sh
$ echo 14 | cargo run -q 2019 1 1
2
```

## Published crate
This crate is published to [crates.io/crates/advent-of-code](https://crates.io/crates/advent-of-code).

As a library it exposes a `solve(year, day, part, input)` function as documented on [docs.rs/advent-of-code](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/):

```rust
// Using the dependency added: advent-of-code = "*":
use advent_of_code::solve;

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(solve(2019, 1, 1, "14"), Ok("2".to_string()));
}
```

It also contains the command line program to run the solution:

```sh
$ cargo install advent-of-code
$ echo 14 | advent-of-code 2019 1 1
2
````

## Docker image on Docker Hub
The command line interface is published to a [fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code](https://hub.docker.com/r/fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code) Docker image:

```sh
$Â docker pull fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code:latest
$ echo 14 | docker run -i fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code:latest 2019 1 1
